DevOps has come a long way since it emerged more than 10 years ago. Systems administrators wanted to keep up with more efficient Agile product development teams, which were creating production-quality software more frequently. Teams were getting better at delivering software, but bottlenecks remained in the rest of the value stream, in areas like up-front planning and the deployment and management of systems in production. Back then—and even now for many organizations—these bottlenecks caused friction between development and operations teams. Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois have been credited with coining the term DevOps in 2008, and the concept took hold with the first DevOpsDays event in Belgium in 2009.
